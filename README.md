# AutocompleteMe
Project created in CS160 - Algorithms


AutocompleteMe used to autocomplete words from a data base. A few data bases are provided as an example. 
Three words will pop up as possible completions to whatever is being typed by the user and will be updated 
after each character addition.

Not all files were created entirely by me:
AutocompleteGUI and the three directories were provided by my professor for this project.
